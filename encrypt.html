    <p>The internet is a rather public thing. The main purpose of the internet is to transport data. Because some of that data 
    is rather private and does not need to be available to the public, data has to be kept safe. Most data is kept safe through 
    being encrypted. This means that the data is changed so that one would have to know a way to decrypt it to be able to access it. 
    </p>
    
    <p>An example of encryption is ten digit encryption. In this case, each of ten things is being shifted a different amount. The first might be shifted by 3, the next shifted by 1, the next 8, until the tenth is shifted by a number. This repeats itself until the entire message has been encrypted. This means that there are about ten billion different combinations on how things might be encrypted. Another example of this sort of encryption is 256 bit encryption. 256 bit encryption means that there are roughly 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,<br>985,008,687,907,853,269,<br>984,665,640,564,039,457,584,<br>007,913,129,639,935 different combinations, according to code.org.</p>
    
    <p>A rather important method of encryption is called asymmetric encryption. In the case of asymmetric ecnryption, there are two keys: a public key, and a private key. While anybody can access the public key, only the owner can access the private key.</p>
