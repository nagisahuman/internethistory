    <p>Most pieces of hardware and software do have some vulnerabilities. Hackers
       can take advantage of these vulnerabilities so that they can infilitrate
       a computer, or gather private information from a computer.</p>
    <p> Hackers can also gather information with phishing scams. This normally happens
      when an email is sent to a user. While the email looks like it is secure and
      from the correct site, it is not. Phishing scams can send the user to a fake
      website, where they might be resetting their password, logging in, or some other
      action. The site can then gather the information the user typed in, and the
      hacker can take this information for their own purpose. For example, they might
      have taken bank account information. They would then use this to log in to
      the actual bank account.

    that the link is not to the PayPal website.">
    <p>Similar to phishing scams are trojans. While it
      may look like a legitimate piece of software or file, it is actually a file that
      will infect a computer. This collect data from the computer. It may also
    create more ways for a hacker to get into the computer. These may be known as
    backdoors.</p>
    <p>Yet another example of malware is a worm. Worms can work by finding a vulnerability
      and exploiting it. It relies on these vulnerabilities to spread itself, normally
      within a computer network. Some worms rely un the user to unknowingly spread
      the worm. An excellent example of a worm is Conficker. It infected several
      million computers. This created a botnet.
