      I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger.

Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. What? What?! WHAT?! Don't you think she looks tired?

I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff.

I don't want to go. Don't you think she looks tired? It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. What? What?! WHAT?! You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.

I don't want to go. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.
